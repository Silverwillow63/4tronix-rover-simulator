    "In this diagram, I've labelled two of the corners to show how this triangle lines up with a couple of the wheels on the rover. Assume in this case that it's the front right steerable wheel, and the non-steering middle right wheel. If we join these two point up with a straight line, and then draw another line at right angles to the left (which will go right through the left-hand non-steerable wheel; I've left the other three wheels off this diagram) and then draw a line coming out of the steerable wheel perpendicular to the direction it is pointing, that line will hit the other line, forming the triangle shown above. And it's that line that's the hypoteneuse.\n",

That they can move freely in the direction they are pointing, and can generally freely change direction, but will resist sliding sideways. The fact that the steerable wheel is pointing off to the left means that it will tend to want to move that way, but because all the wheels are attached to the same rover, this will tend to cause the rover to rotate (because the middle wheels want to head straight up, so the front wheel will end up pushing the front of the vehicle to the left, causing rotation). As this continues, the wheels will all gradually turn to the left along with the rover. Because they resist being moved sideways relative to where they are pointing, they will all tend to maintain the same distance from the left corner of the circle (because that corner is directly sideways from all of the wheels), and so they will move in a circle. (A circle is what you get when something moves, turning continuously but maintaining a constant distance from a particular point.)\n",

There are lots of reasons this simulation isn't going to be very accurate, so it doesn't really matter if we simplify things where we can. The way we do it is that a few times a second, we run code that tries to work out how the rover is moving. It basically says \"if the rover is here, and pointing this way, and the wheels are pointing these ways and turning this fast, how fast is the rover moving and in what direction, and what way is it turning?\". The part where we cheat is that we then assume that the answer to these questions will stay the same for the little fraction of a second that we're looking at. This isn't actually true - the rover is in continuous motion, which means that its speed and direction might be changing at all times. But we just pretend that it's OK to say \"Well, it's moving 10cm a second and it's pointing north, so in 1 tenth of a second it will have moved 1cm north\". If you work it out with small enough slices of time, it's a reasonable simluation.\n",

    "So it hasn't turned much - just 0.622 degrees (roughly). But then we're only talking about what it does in a tenth of a second. And the wheel wasn't turned by much. So it shouldn't be surprising. Earlier, we worked out that the turning circle has a radius of about 46cm, and a circumference of about 289cm, so if it's travelling at about 5cm per second, we'd expect it to take quite a long time to complete one rotation.\n",

We know how far it is from the steerable wheel, but we don't yet have its location. We can do this with trigonometry too. We'll first work it out relative to the rover. This makes it simple because we know it's going to be directly to the left or right - it's the corner of the right-angled triangle formed by a line from the centre to the corner wheel and the line going through the middle of the rover.\n",

That sounds about right - we worked out the steerable front wheel was about 46cm from the circle's centre. We'd expect the middle wheel to be a teeny bit closer, and then the middle wheel is about 8cm from the centre of the rover so it'll be closer still.\n",

Notice that we negate the `vehicleHeadingRadians` because we're using positive values to signify clockwise rotation, as is normal with compass headings, but generally in mathematics, positive values denote anticlockwise changes in angle, and Python's `math.cos` and `math.sin` use that convention. So we negate the angle to deal with that."
